# Goonj 🔉
 An app for the elderly.
 
##  🌎  Overview
**Old age is a time where the process of learning gets slower, adapting gets harder. Yet with the advancement in technology, people have to move with the pace and get used to it. Just to make this process simpler, I'hv built this app for their entertainment. The UI has been kept simple and minimalistic to avoid any kind of misclicks that may lead to a chain reaction of processes. Features has been listed below :D.
